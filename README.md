In this project, you will finalize the previous project 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly).

You will reuse final files of 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and update them.

You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

My name is Ashley Price, I am a Front End Web Developer based in Oklahoma. I currently attend Holberton, and will complete the Full Stack Web Development program in April, 2022. I believe in simply beautiful and functional code, and making tech accessible for all. I enjoy the constant challenge web development provides, and ultimately would love to be part of a team that challenges each other to constantly improve and continue learning. I personally enjoy CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Javascript, Liquid, SASS/SCSS, and Python.
