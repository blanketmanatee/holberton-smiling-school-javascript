In this project, I finalized the previous project 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and make some parts dynamic with Javascript.

This project serves as a culmination of HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript concepts I have learned so far in the first trimester of specializations at Holberton.

My name is Ashley Price, I am a Front End Web Developer based in Oklahoma. I currently attend Holberton, and will complete the Full Stack Web Development program in April, 2022. I believe in simply beautiful and functional code, and making tech accessible for all. I enjoy the constant challenge web development provides, and ultimately would love to be part of a team that challenges each other to constantly improve and continue learning. I personally enjoy CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Javascript, Liquid, SASS/SCSS, and Python.
